Hello!!! This document is to show the conflict and how we fixed it.

Here is a comparison of ingredients.md from both of the pull request

Sir Murray  -    Sheehan

top bun         top bun
Cheese          juicy beef
Pickle          bottom bun
Tofu
Ham
bottom bun

As you can see there are overlapping ingridients on both of the files so a merge conflict will happen.
In order to fix this I decided to move my juicy beef and bottom bun to bottom and it will look like this.
and add one extra line on to sir murray ingredients so my beef will fit in to it.

It will look like this.
